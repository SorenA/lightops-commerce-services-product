## gRPC services

Protobuf service definitions located at [SorenA/lightops-commerce-proto](https://github.com/SorenA/lightops-commerce-proto).

Product v1 is implemented in `Domain.Services.V1.ProductGrpcService`.

Health v1 is implemented in `Domain.Services.V1.HealthGrpcService`.

### Health-check

Health-checks conforms to the [GRPC Health Checking Protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md)

Available services are as follows

```bash
service = '' - System as a whole
service = 'service.content_page.v1.ProtoProductService' - Product v1
```
